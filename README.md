# bookclub-analytics
Program used to provide various analytics on books read by your book club.  Yes, there are a million other ways to accomplish this, but I wanted something built specifically for book club.  Analytics currently is something very difficult to do for the general sense, and must be built and applied to specific use cases such as this.

Currently the program supports the following analytics:
1) # of male authors
2) # of female authors
3) # of total books read
4) # of books older than x number of years


Future analytics include the following:
1) Statistics on # of books in each specified category
2) Number of pages per book
3) Book with the most pages

Right now the data sits in a flat .dat file, but the goal is to eventually migrate it to an appropriate kind of database. Suggestions are welcomed!  I'd also like to make program interactive via a web portal and provide graphs and charts of the data.
